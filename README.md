# Beltrami-Coefficient-Map
This pipeline, consisting of three major steps: 
1. cortical surface conformal parameterization, 
2. surface-spline-based cortical activation signal smoothing, 
3. vertex-wise Beltrami coefficient-based map description. 

By correcting most of the topological violations, the result was a “Beltrami coefficient map”(BCM) that completely characterizes the retinotopic map by quantifying the local quasiconformal mapping distortion at each visual field location. The BCM provided topological and fully reconstructable retinotopic maps.
